 * @description
 * CWE: 129 Improper Validation of Array Index
 * BadSource: getCookies_Servlet Read data from the first cookie using getCookies()
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
 * Sinks: array_read_check_max
 *    GoodSink: Read from array after verifying index is at least 0 and less than array.length
 *    BadSink : Read from array after verifying that data less than array.length (but not verifying that data is at least 0)
 * Flow Variant: 52 Data flow: data passed as an argument from one method to another to another in three different classes in the same package
